[03:07:36]: <== The following assertion was thrown during layout:

[03:07:36]: <== The relevant error-causing widget was:
[03:07:36]: <==   Column
[03:07:36]: <==   Column:file:///C:/Users/Vinicius%20Vitoriano/Desktop/TCC/olimtec_tcc/lib/app/features/championship/views/initial_config/add_modality_component.dart:71:24
[03:07:36]: <== The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
[03:07:36]: <== The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
[03:07:36]: <== black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
[03:07:36]: <== Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
[03:07:36]: <== RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
[03:07:36]: <== This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
[03:07:36]: <== seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
[03:07:36]: <== ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
[03:07:36]: <== like a ListView.

[03:19:39]: <== The following assertion was thrown during performResize():
[03:19:39]: <== Vertical viewport was given unbounded height.
[03:19:39]: <== Viewports expand in the scrolling direction to fill their container. In this case, a vertical
[03:19:39]: <== viewport was given an unlimited amount of vertical space in which to expand. This situation
[03:19:39]: <== typically happens when a scrollable widget is nested inside another scrollable widget.
[03:19:39]: <== If this widget is always nested in a scrollable widget there is no need to use a viewport because
[03:19:39]: <== there will always be enough vertical space for the children. In this case, consider using a Column
[03:19:39]: <== or Wrap instead. Otherwise, consider using a CustomScrollView to concatenate arbitrary slivers into
[03:19:39]: <== a single scrollable.

[03:21:34]: <== The following assertion was thrown during performResize():
[03:21:34]: <== Vertical viewport was given unbounded height.
[03:21:34]: <== Viewports expand in the scrolling direction to fill their container. In this case, a vertical
[03:21:34]: <== viewport was given an unlimited amount of vertical space in which to expand. This situation
[03:21:34]: <== typically happens when a scrollable widget is nested inside another scrollable widget.
[03:21:34]: <== If this widget is always nested in a scrollable widget there is no need to use a viewport because

[03:21:58]: <== The following assertion was thrown during performResize():
[03:21:58]: <== Vertical viewport was given unbounded height.
[03:21:58]: <== Viewports expand in the scrolling direction to fill their container. In this case, a vertical
[03:21:58]: <== viewport was given an unlimited amount of vertical space in which to expand. This situation
[03:21:58]: <== typically happens when a scrollable widget is nested inside another scrollable widget.
[03:21:58]: <== If this widget is always nested in a scrollable widget there is no need to use a viewport because
[03:21:58]: <== there will always be enough vertical space for the children. In this case, consider using a Column
